Music Machine
=============

Cartridge uses Ultimax Mode memory  $f000-$ffff.

Screen memory is set to $0400 and Character Set to $3000.
In Ultimax mode the $3000 address is remapped to the ROM at $f000,
thus the first $200 bytes of the cartridge ROM should be used by
the emulator as character set.

This doesn't work in the latest test version of CCS64.
